Meet the WOO

Meet the woo - 
Wonderful trap style beat to really hit those sub woofers different,
Fairly aggressive lyrics relating to gang culture in Brooklyn, he says he's gonna kill someone
in precisely 11 different ways in one verse, kinda dope
Welcome to the party - 
Another skull rumbling beat playing around with low volume clipping in a really interesting way
Im a thot get me lit is genuinely kind of a bar
Bad bitch from overseas is a genuinely hilarious line to me and i dont know why
He seems mad that everyone apart from him is 1: a pussy 2: faster at running than him
Hawk em - 
Boof what up: lmao
Im a gentleman and gangster" double G is the most incredible ego shit I've ever seen committed to
a record, I have to drop my resentment at him calling himself a gentleman after quite literally
murdering people because this bragadocio is so unreal
Better have your gun - 
I like the flow in the verses a LOT, my fave so far, just so lazy and indifferent feels GREAT
Scenario - 
He said my body different HAHA, 
Almost Organ music in the instrumental gives this a bit of an edge, he said he'd always be pistol packin
but he got killed in a home invasion so he's losing points for that
Dior - 
Homophobia in 2019? - Cringe
Feeling - 
Bloodlust song that's repetetive and has maybe the most boring beat
PTSD - 
Kinda good but so INCONGRUOUS with the rest of the album
Brother man - 
Hmmm, this album lost me ill be honest, I'm not too into 'i killed someone' as the whole theme for an album
that is so patchy in terms of how good each song sounds without lyrics making an impact
