J. Cole - KOD;
Intro- 
Smooth and melancholic, seats itself nicely at the head of the table for conversational purposes
KOD - 
Instrumental was a overly reliant on overdriven bass contrasting with the light bell sound for my liking,
"I dont like my fans" feel to the song, cool? no.
Photograph - 
Incel anthem -BIG yikes "i shoot my shot and it brick"
The Cut Off -
 Instrumental slaps like this guy with a tambourine https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/comments/jocfiz/man_plays_tambourine_while_cat_vibes/
maybe lose kill edward he didnt hit me with the vibes ngl
The level of hilarious lack of self - perspective from one song to the next makes me think hes literally a "nice guy"
ATM - 
a return to the debauchery angle without fulfilment which goes OFF
Motiv8 - 
I like it, kinda goofy but gives me a slice of GOMD's energy but overly restrained i think
Kevins Heart - Nutty instrumental, baker cake lines made me smile, another shift to being unhappy in a different situation which he felt should be satisfying, 
definitely in keeping with his primary theme of being a sadBoi (tm)
BRACKETS - 
A surprisingly nuanced take from mr Cole, genuinely surprised with how much more meaning this had 
Once an Addict - Genuinely resonated with me, broken home gang! You can tell when he actually cares about the lyrics,
sadly its lacking with most of the album where he wants to be that lazy voiced effervescent top of the head thoughts
FRIENDS - 
Again he cares, and it shows, the words are more of an extension of self than any of the masked earlier tracks, 
maybe it speaks to the journey hes making through the album, wanting to talk about real shit becasue he knows his problems arent
relatable but still wants to get them out hence the lack of conviction early on.
Window Pain - 
Trying to relate to others pain while still holding on to fact that pain is absolute not relative has actually been explored fairly well, if rather bluntly,
reminds me of being surrounded by cigarette butts in my uni dorm and being too tired to cry 
1985 - 
A kinda fitting way to end, knowing he isn't perfect but seeing the youthful mistakes by the next generation and seeing himself without that perspective
that age will undoubtedly bring with time on your hands.
